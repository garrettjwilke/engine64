/*
	3D character collision

	How to add primitive shape colliders to scene models.

	What this example adds over example 02:

		colliders built from primitive shapes instead of a mesh
		friction and restitution declared per shape
		a character with three gaits, sprint and stamina
		content split one file per piece

	The room's collision is a triangle mesh built by the importer from the same
	.glb, as in example 02. Primitives are the other way to declare collision:
	measurements written in code, with no asset behind them.

	Content lives one file per piece: room and character under prefabs/, the
	light, the fog and the camera under scene/, the button bindings under
	controls/. What stays here is the placement table and the state that runs
	the frame.

	The primitives are declared here, next to the placements that use them.

/* --- the primitives --------------------------------------------------------
	Collision is declared in two steps, and both are needed. A
	physics::Shape::Def is one solid: its kind, the measurements that kind
	takes, and what it does on contact. A collider::Def is the array of
	those shapes plus how many there are, and that is what the prefab
	points at. They are separate because one body can carry several shapes,
	each with its own offset, so a prefab always takes a collider even when it
	holds a single shape.

	Shapes are in metres.
