/*
	3D character

	How to create a simple static mesh character.

	A character is a body the engine moves for the game. It is not simulated by
	the physics solver: it collides itself against the world's static shapes,
	resolves its own penetration and writes its own transform. What it does is
	entirely decided by the settings declared below, since the engine ships no
	movement values of its own.

	What this example adds over example 01:

		a Prefab3D of type PREFAB3D_CHARACTER, carrying a character3d::Def
		a collision mesh on the room, so the body has something to stand on
		a control binding per piece that moves, named by the state
		an update that reads the seat, moves the body and follows it

	One gait is declared, which is the proportional locomotion case: speed
	follows stick displacement. Collision and the solver itself are example 03.
