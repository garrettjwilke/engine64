	   its layer as it is met, and the layers are then applied first to last,
	   every one blended over the result of the ones before it with its own
	   weight.

	   Two consequences the table has to be built around:

	   1. A layer at full weight replaces the whole pose. Everything blended
	      before it is discarded. The full-body grids reach full weight while
	      they drive the body, so they go FIRST; the partial and action layers
	      go AFTER every grid, or the grid that happens to be at full weight
	      erases them.

	   2. A SEQUENCE or SELECT node that only advances a clip into a buffer
	      can sit anywhere before the LAYER node that reads that buffer; only
	      the LAYER's position decides where the pose lands in the stack.

	   The engine does not sort this and cannot: which grid weighs 1 changes
	   with the state, and the asset is the one that knows what its layers
	   mean. */
