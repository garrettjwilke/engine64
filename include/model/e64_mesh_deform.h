/*
	Drives a t3d vertex buffer from an external set of points.

	Binds every vertex slot of a model to the source point sitting at the same
	rest position, then rewrites the buffer from those points on demand. The
	source is a plain array, so anything that moves points can drive a mesh:
	a collision mesh under simulation, a morph target, a spline.

	Binding by position rather than by index is what makes this work: t3d
	chunks, pads and reorders vertices when it builds the model, and glTF
	splits them again per UV seam and material border, so one source point
	usually lands on several slots and never on a predictable one.
